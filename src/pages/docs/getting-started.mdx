<!-- Welcome to Tensei JS! This quick start guide will get you up and running in just a few seconds. Let's build a simple  -->
## What is Tensei?
Tensei is an elegant, open-source headless CMS that makes it very fast and easy to build powerful and secure APIs.
Out of the box, you can setup a fully customisable GraphQL or Rest API with `email/password` and `social` authentication, JWT, access and refresh tokens, Role Based Access Control (`RBAC`) and a beautiful, fully customisable headless CMS dashboard to manage your content seamlessly.

Tensei supports `Mysql`, `MongoDB`, `Sqlite` and `Postgresql` out of the box. Database communication is implemented using the amazing [Mikro ORM](https://mikro-orm.io/), a fast and secure ORM for Node.js.

## Requirements
Before we setup your first project, make sure you have a basic development environment setup, with the following tools installed on your system:

<List>
  <ListItemGood><a href='https://nodejs.org'>Node.js</a> >= v12, preferrably an LTS version</ListItemGood>
  <ListItemGood>
    <a href='https://yarnpkg.com'>Yarn</a> or <a href='https://npmjs.com'>npm</a> package manager
  </ListItemGood>
</List>

## Setup a new Tensei project
You can generate a project using a single command:

```shell
yarn create tensei-app ecommerce-app

# Or using npm
npx create-tensei-app ecommerce-app
```

This will generate a new project in a folder called `ecommerce-app` with GraphQL and authentication already setup for you.

Tensei requires very little code to run, so you'll see only three files in the generated project: `.gitignore`, `package.json` and `index.js` file.

The `index.js` file contains your server, and the content should look like this:

```javascript
const { auth } = require('@tensei/auth')
const { tensei } = require('@tensei/core')
const { graphql } = require('@tensei/graphql')

tensei()
    .plugins([
        auth()
            .plugin(),
        graphql()
            .plugin()
    ])
    .databaseConfig({
        type: 'sqlite',
        dbName: 'ecommerce_app.sqlite',
    })
    .start()
```

This file creates a new `tensei()` instance, registers the `auth()` and `graphql()` plugins, configures `sqlite` as the database, and `starts()` the server.

Run the server with `yarn dev`. You should see the following message:

```shell
âœ”  success   ðŸš€ Access your server on http://127.0.0.1:4500
```

You can now access your `GraphQL` API on [http://127.0.0.1:4500/graphql](http://127.0.0.1:4500/graphql)

Please take a moment to try out the mutations and queries specified in the GraphQL explorer, or if you're using Rest, make API calls with a Rest client such as [Postman](https://postman.com) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/).

Congratulations, you've successfully run your first Tensei app ðŸŽ‰.
