description: How to programmatically send mails in Tensei
---

Tensei ships with the `@tensei/mail` package, a simple wrapper around [nodemailer](https://nodemailer.org) to mail sending mails easy.

By default, you may send emails using [AWS SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/), SMTP, [Sparkpost](https://sparkpost.com), [Mailgun](https://mailgun.com) and [Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com).
