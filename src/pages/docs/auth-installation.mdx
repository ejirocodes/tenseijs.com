<List>
  <ListItemGood>
    Session-based authentication
  </ListItemGood>
  <ListItemGood>
    JWT authentication with refresh tokens and refresh token rotation
  </ListItemGood>
  <ListItemGood>
    Social authentication
  </ListItemGood>
  <ListItemGood>
    Role based access control
  </ListItemGood>
  <ListItemGood>
    Email verification & Confirmation
  </ListItemGood>
  <ListItemGood>
    Password resets
  </ListItemGood>
  <ListItemGood>
    Two-factor authentication
  </ListItemGood>
  <ListItemGood>
    User blocking / Unblocking
  </ListItemGood>
</List>

## Installation
You may install the auth plugin with the following command:

```shell
yarn add @tensei/auth

# Or with nom 
npm install --save @tensei/auth
```

## Register the plugin
You may register the auth plugin by adding it to the `plugins()` method of your tensei instance:

```js
const { auth } = require('@tensei/auth')
const { tensei } = require('@tensei/core')

tensei()
    .plugins([
        auth().plugin()
    ])
```

Make sure this plugin is registered before the `graphql()` or `rest()` plugins, that way, it can register new routes, queries and types before the API is booted.

## Session-based authentication
By default, once you register the plugin, you have secure, cookie-based authentication setup. This method of authentication is highly recommended for web applications running on the same domain. 

Since third-party cookies are not fully supported, if your frontend application is running on a different domain from your backend, you may need to use JWT authentication.

By default, the auth plugin adds the following types and queries to the GraphQL API:

```graphql
input insert_user_input {
  email: String!
  password: String!
}

type user {
    id: ID!
    email: String
    created_at: String
    updated_at: String
}

type register_user_response {
  user: user!
}

type login_user_response {
  user: user!
}

input reset_user_password_input {
  email: String!
  token: String!
  password: String!
}

input request_user_password_reset_input {
    email: String!
}

extend type Mutation {
    logout_user: Boolean!
    login_user(object: login_user_input!): login_user_response!
    register_user(object: insert_user_input!): register_user_response!

    reset_user_password(object: reset_user_password_input!): Boolean!
    request_user_password_reset(object: request_user_password_reset_input!): Boolean!
}

extend type Query {
    authenticated_user: user!
}
```

If you're using the REST plugin, the following endpoints are added:

- `POST auth/register` for registering new users
- `POST auth/login` for creating new user sessions
- `POST auth/logout` for logging out an authenticated user
- `GET auth/me` for getting the currently authenticated user
- `POST auth/passwords/email` for requesting a password reset
- `POST auth/passwords/reset` for reset a user's password

### Csrf Protection
If you are using session-based authentication which we highly recommend for web apps, your application might be vulnerable to CSRF attacks in older browsers. Tensei auth ships with Csrf protection by default when using session-based authentication.
This means when your client application is making a `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` or `DELETE` request to the API, it would need to provide a valid CSRF token.

To obtain a CSRF token, you may call the `GET /auth/csrf` endpoint. This endpoint returns a 204 no content, but will set the csrf token as a cookie in the response. Here's how you would do this with Axios:

```js
import axios from 'axios'

axios
  .get('/auth/csrf')
  .then(console.log)
```

Modern HTTP clients such as Axios will automatically include this csrf cookie in headers when making further requests to the API.

### Csrf with GraphQL
If using GraphQL, you may query the `csrf_token` query to set the csrf token in the browser. Again this would return no data, but would include the csrf token in the response as cookies.

```js
import Cookies from 'js-cookie'
import { GraphQLClient } from "graphql-request";

const client = new GraphQLClient('http://localhost:4500/graphql', {
    credentials: "include", // !!! Super important to persist session
})

const CSRF_TOKEN = gql`
  csrf_token
`

// This request returns a cookie in the response.
client.request(CSRF_TOKEN).then(() => {
    // Set CSRF Token on headers
    client.setHeader('x-csrf-token', Cookies.get('x-csrf-token'))
})
```

### User registration
This provides a way for adding new users to your application. By default, only two fields are accepted: `email` and `password`. The password is automatically hashed before storing in the database. 
It creates a session for the newly registered user by setting a cookie in the response, thus authenticating the user right away. Here's how you can register new users using axios:

```js
import axios from 'axios'

async function register() {
  // Set the CSRF COOKIE
  await axios.get('auth/csrf')

  // Axios automatically sends the csrf cookie as a header
  const { user } = await axios.post('http://localhost:4500/auth/register', {
      email: 'hey@tenseijs.com',
      password: 'password'
  })

  // console.log(user)
}
```

If you're using GraphQL, here's how you'll call the `register_user` mutation:

```js
import Cookies from 'js-cookie'
import { GraphQLClient } from "graphql-request";

const client = new GraphQLClient('http://localhost:4500/graphql', {
    credentials: "include", // !!! Super important to persist session
})

// Set CSRF Token 
client.setHeader('x-csrf-token', Cookies.get('x-csrf-token'))

const REGISTER_USER = gql`
    mutation register_user($email: String!, $password: String!) {
        register_user(object: {
            email: $email,
            password: $password
        }) {
            user {
                id
                created_at
            }
        }
    }
`

// Pass in the query and the variables
client.request(REGISTER_USER, {
    email: 'hey@tenseijs.com',
    password: 'password'
}).then(console.log)
```

### User login
This provides a way to start a session for a user. Only two fields are accepted: `email` and `password`. This endpoint compares the password to make sure it matches, and starts a new session by setting a cookie in the response.  

### Password resets
When a user forget's their password, they can go through the password reset flow to identify and reset to a new password. Here's how this flow should go:

- First, the user provides their email on your client-side, and you call the `POST auth/passwords/email` endpoint or `request_user_password_reset` mutation with this email. The auth plugin will find this user, and if the user exists, will send an email to the user with a unique password resets token embedded in a confirmation link. 

```js
const FORGOT_PASSWORD = gql`
    mutation request_user_password_reset($email: String!) {
        request_user_password_reset(object: {
            email: $email
        })
    }
`

client.query({
    query: FORGOT_PASSWORD,
    variables: {
        email: 'hey@tenseijs.com'
    }
}).then(console.log)
```

- Secondly, the user visits their email and clicks on the confirmation link. This link sends them back to your client-side application. This action should take them to a form requesting their new password.

- Next, you need to extract the password reset token from the query string, and make a call to the `POST auth/passwords/reset` endpoint or `reset_user_password` mutation with the reset token and new password to reset the password.

```js
const RESET_PASSWORD = gql`
    mutation reset_user_password($password: String!, $token: String!) {
        reset_user_password(object: {
            password: $password,
            token: $token
        })
    }
`

// Pass in query and variables
client.request(RESET_PASSWORD, {
    token: 'gj6uyxxfg359kndc9dvwg286pk5whcnzm8h34xdq828cargxn94',
    password: 'new-password'
}).then(console.log)
```

### Get authenticated user
After login, to get the currently authenticated user, you may call the `GET auth/me` endpoint or the `authenticated_user` query. Make sure to set `credentials: include` configuration on your HTTP client, so it automatically sends the cookie along to the server.

The backend server validates this cookie, identifies the user, and responds with the user's details.

Here's an example on how to get the authenticated user with axios:

```js
import Axios from 'axios'

const instance = Axios.create({
    withCredentials: true,
    baseURL: 'http://localhost:4500'
})

instance.get('auth/me').then(console.log)
```

## JWT authentication
Tensei implements the best practices for JWT and refresh tokens authentication as recommended by the [Internet Engineering Task Force](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-browser-based-apps-05#section-8).

To enable JWT authentication, you may call the `.noCookies()` method on the auth plugin instance:

```js
const { auth } = require('@tensei/auth')
const { tensei } = require('@tensei/core')

tensei()
    .plugins([
        auth()
            .noCookies()
            .plugin()
    ])
```

Now, the graphQL schema will change, adding access tokens and refresh tokens to the responses:

```graphql
type login_user_response {
  access_token: String!
  refresh_token: String!
  expires_in: Int!
  user: user!
}

type register_user_response {
  access_token: String!
  refresh_token: String!
  expires_in: Int!
  user: user!
}
```

- The `access_token` is a valid JWT, and by default, this token expires in 20 minutes.
- The `refresh_token` is a unique random token, which by default expires in 6 months.
- The `expires_in` is the amount of time left until the access token expires.

### User Registration
User registration works exactly as with [session-based authentication](#user-registration), but this time the `access_token` and `refresh_token` will be included in the response body. Also, no CSRF protection is required.

### User login
User login works exactly as with [session-based authentication](#user-login), but this time the `access_token` and `refresh_token` will be included in the response body. Also, no CSRF protection is required.

### Password resets
Password resets work exactly as with [session-based authentication](#password-resets). Also, no CSRF protection is required.

### Get authenticated user
To get the authenticated user, you need to provide the access_token in the request header as a bearer token. Here's how you would get the authenticated user with axios:

```js
import axios from 'axios'

const access_token = '...'

const instance = Axios.create({
    baseURL: 'http://localhost:4500'
})

instance.defaults.headers.common['Authorization'] = `Bearer ${access_token}`

instance.get('auth/me').then(console.log)
```
