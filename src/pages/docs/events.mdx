description: Understand events and event emitters in Tensei

Tensei ships with an event emitter based on the [emittery library](https://github.com/sindresorhus/emittery). The most popular use cases for events and listeners is performing actions after operations are completed in the application. For example, after a user is registered, a `user::registered` event is emitted.

## Emitting events

To emit a new event, you may use the emittery instance from the context (or request) instance. Let's say you have a route that deletes a user account:

```js
const { tensei, route } = require('@tensei/core')

tensei()
    .routes([
        route('Delete customer account')
            .handle(async ({ emitter, manager, params }, response) => {
                await manager.remove('Customer', params.id)

                emitter.emit('customer::deleted', params.id)

                return response.noContent()
            })
    ])
```

Many plugins that add custom routes and graphql queries will emit events after actions are performed.

## Listening to events
To listen to events, you may use the `.events()` method on the tensei instance.

```js
const { tensei, route, event } = require('@tensei/core')

tensei()
    .events([
        event('customer::deleted')
            .listen(async ({ payload, ctx }) => {
                ctx.mailer.send((message) => message.to(payload.email))
            })
            .listen(async ({ payload, ctx }) => {
                ctx.manager.update('Customer', {...}, {...})
            })
    ])
```

You may register as many event listeners as possible to one event. All of these listeners will be called asynchronously when the event is triggered.

## Listening to events in plugins
If you are building a plugin, you may use the `extendEvents` method to add event listeners:

```js
const { plugin, event } = require('@tensei/common')

plugin('Manager Users')
    .boot(({ extendEvents }) => {
        extendEvents([
            event('user::registered')
                .listen(async ({ payload }) => {...})
        ])
    })
```
