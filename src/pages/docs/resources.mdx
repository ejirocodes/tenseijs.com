## What is a resource?

A resource in Tensei represents the principal way to interact with your database, API and CMS dashboard. It will always correspond to a single database table or collection in your application.

For each resource, Tensei will generate smart and customisable `CRUD` functionality a REST or GraphQL API. Resources can also be managed from the Tensei CMS dashbaord.

## Defining Resources

To define a resource, use the `resource` function. The first argument is the name of the resource. It returns a resource highly customisable resource instance.

```js
const { resource } = require('@tensei/core')

const Post = resource('Post')
```

Each resource maps to a database table or collection. By default, the `Post` resource would connect to a database table called `posts`, which matches the plural, lowercase of the resource name. The `Tag` resource would connect to the `tags` table, and the `Customer Expense` resource would connect to the `customer_expenses` table.

## Registering Resources

The `resources` method on the Tensei instance can be used to register all resources of the application. It takes in an array resource instances.

```js
const { tensei, resource } = require('@tensei/core')

tensei()
    .resources([
        resource('Tag'),
        resource('Post'),
        resource('Author'),
        resource('Comment'),
    ])
```

## Defining resource fields
The `.fields()` method can be used to define resource fields. Each field corresponds to a table column, and will show up on the CMS dashboard. All possible fields such as `number()`, `text()`, `textarea()` etc. are exported from the `@tensei/core` package.
This is how you will define fields for a `Tag` in your application.

```js
const { tensei, resource, boolean, text, textarea } = require('@tensei/core')

tensei()
    .resources([
        resource('Tag')
            .fields([
                text('Name'),
                boolean('Active'),
                textarea('Description')
            ])
    ])
    .db(...)
    .start()
```

For more information about defining and cutomising fields, see the [fields documentation](/docs/fields).

## Resource Groups
By default, all resources show up on the dashboard sidebar in a `Resources` group. 
If you would like to separate resources into different sidebar groups on the dashboard, you may call the `group` method on the resource instance.

```js
const { tensei, resource } = require('@tensei/core')

tensei()
    .resources([
        resource('Post').group('Blog & Writing'),
        resource('Author').group('Blog & Writing'),
    ])
```

Now the `Post` and `Author` resources would be in the same group. This is a great way to separate concerns on your dashboard.

## Pagination
If you'd like to customize the data shown on each resource's "per page" filter menu, you can do so by calling the `.perPageOptions()` method on the resource:

```javascript
resource('Post')
    .perPageOptions([25, 50, 100, 250, 500])
```

The number of rows fetched on the resource page would default to the first `perPageOption` defined.

## Hiding resources
If you don't want a resource to appear in the sidebar, you may call the `.hideFromNavigation()` method on your resource instance:

```javascript
resource('Post')
    .hideFromNavigation()
```

## Disabling timestamps
By default, all registered resources have 3 fields: `ID()`, `timestamp('Created At')` and `timestamp('Updated At')`. To disable the timestamps registered by default, you may call the `.noTimestamps()` method.

```javascript
resource('Product')
    .noTimeStamps()
```
